title: Create a network between VMs in Oracle VirtualHost
---
 Creating a network between 2 Oracle VirtualHost VMs will be handy for testing/learning topics such as Clustering,
 SAN, Load balancing etc.One way to connect the VMs is by using "Internal Network" Option.
 
 Go to network section on each VM and select "Internal Network".
