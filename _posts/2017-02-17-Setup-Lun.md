title: Setup iSCSI target and initiator
---
  
In storage Logical Unit Number(LUN) is a logical number used to identify a logical unit that can be accessed by iSCSI protocol.
The logical unit can be a hard disk or a portion of hard disk or an lvm partition. The computer that connects to the storage 
server to import the block device represented by the LUN id will be the initiator and the server which provides the block device 
will be the target.

LUN generally comes under Storage Area Network(SAN) when a storage area needs to shared among multiple nodes. For example, a web cluster setup. 

We have 2 centos-7 VMs. scsiserver acting as the target and scsiclient acting as the initiator.

First we will configure target on scsiserver.
Install the package scsi-target-utils
> yum -y install scsi-target-utils

tgtd is the target service. Make sure that the service is running on the server. 
targets.conf file contains the sample configuration of targets. One target can have more than one backing store attached.
backing store is the actual storage device in the backend.
