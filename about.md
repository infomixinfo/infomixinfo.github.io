Hi there!

This is Sreenadh.



I am a Systems Engineer by profession, and an OpenSource enthusiast by heart! I enjoy learning and trying out different 
technologies out there. I like to get my hands dirty while learning, and will be sharing my journey through different terrains such as Linux,Storage,AWS etc.. here.
